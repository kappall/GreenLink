- Real-time user location tracking
- Tap markers for quick details with navigation to full views

### User Profiles
- View user activity: posts, events, and comments
- Edit profile information
- Role-based badges (user, partner, admin)

### Authentication
- Email/password registration and login
- Anonymous browsing mode
- Partner activation via token
- Location-based onboarding

### Admin Dashboard
- User management and reporting
- Partner creation
- Content moderation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** (≥ 3.9.2) - follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio** - for the Android SDK, emulator, and build tools
- **Xcode** (macOS only) - for iOS development
- **Git**

Verify your setup by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kappall/GreenLink
   cd GreenLink
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run code generation** (for Freezed models and Riverpod providers)

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   Connect an Android/iOS device or start an emulator, then:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Building for Release

#### Android APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

To install on a connected device:

```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

#### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

Then archive and distribute through Xcode.

### Regenerating Assets

After modifying the app icon or splash screen assets:

```bash
# Regenerate splash screen
dart run flutter_native_splash:create

# Regenerate launcher icons
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

```

Each feature module follows a consistent internal structure:

- **`models/`** — Data classes (typically generated with Freezed)
- **`providers/`** — Riverpod providers for state management
- **`pages/`** — Screen-level UI widgets
- **`widgets/`** — Feature-specific reusable widgets
- **`services/`** — Business logic and API interactions

## Architecture

GreenLink uses a **feature-based architecture** with a clear separation of concerns:

- **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) with code generation provides reactive state management and dependency injection across the app.
- **Navigation**: [Go Router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) handles declarative routing with authentication-aware redirects — unauthenticated users are redirected to login, while admin users get access to additional management routes.
- **Real-time Updates**: [Socket.IO](https://pub.dev/packages/socket_io_client) enables live updates to the feed and event data.
- **Data Models**: [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) generates immutable, serializable data classes with JSON support.
- **Theming**: Material 3 design with a green color scheme (`#059669`), ensuring a consistent and modern look.

- [**README_INSTALL.md**](README_INSTALL.md) — Android installation guide (in Italian)

## Troubleshooting

- Run `flutter doctor` to diagnose common setup issues.
- Ensure your device is recognized by `adb devices` (Android) or appears in Xcode (iOS).
- If you encounter dependency issues, try `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.
- For code generation issues, run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
